# TIMELINE CREATOR

This app is my first proper foray into the React framework. It takes in dates and descriptions from a form and dynamically creates a visually pleasing timeline graphic as they are added and removed.

The timeline creation website is one of my favorite solo projects in recent memory. It's been tons of fun learning the ins and outs of React, and seeing my idea come to life.




## Possible future goals:
* Add ability to edit events in list pane
* Add animations to the canvas elements to make their appearance more natural
* UI/beautification pass
* Add button to easily download timeline image
* Ability to save, load, and edit previous timelines?
